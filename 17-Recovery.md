Challenge

> A contract creator has built a very simple token factory contract. Anyone can create new tokens with ease. After deploying the first token contract, the creator sent 0.001 ether to obtain more tokens. They have since lost the contract address.

This level will be completed if you can recover (or remove) the 0.001 ether from the lost contract address.

Solution

We need to call `destroy` function of `SimpleToken` contract to get our `ETH` and get the latest instance hope on the whatever the you are playing on i am playing in `sepolia` paste the address in testnet explorer site and click on the `internal tx` tab, you will see contract creation top right corner and grab the address hope on the remix get the `SimpleToken` and paste the your address in `At Address` blow deploy button. now call the `destroy` function with `your account` address you will withdraw `0.001 ETH` from the SimpleToken contract. now submit the instance your challenge will be cleared.🎉
