### [ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) - Ethernaut is a Web3/Solidity based wargame meant to be played in the EVM. The game was inspired by overthewire. Each level is a smart contract that the user must hack, and the game allows users to both learn about ethereum and see their skills compare to historical hacks. The game may have an infinite number of levels.
